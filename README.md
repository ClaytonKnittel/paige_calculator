<h1>Age Calculator</h1>
<h3>Calculate someone's age on Christmas day 2050 given their birthday</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Take the input of someone's birthday in the format mm/dd/yyyy.</li>
  <li>Compute and print the age of this person on the date December 25, 2050.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Be careful about rounding up or down based upon if that person has had their birthday that year or not!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Add a comment if they are over 100:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This person is unlikely to celebrate this Christmas :(</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Add a comment if they are born on leap day of a valid leap year:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This person is born on leap day!</li>
    <li>Assume all years divisible by 4 are leap years (this is not technically true, but mostly accurate).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Make output neat and conversational.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use a main function and a class structure.</h3>

<h3>Birthday input constraints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Birth months must be integers 1-12.</li>
  <li>Birth days must be integers between 1 and 28-31. Check for given months what is valid (i.e. Feb 29 can only happen on a leap year, April 31 is not a date, etc.).</li>
  <li>Birth year must be after 0 and before 2050.</li>
  <li>Birthday must be given in the format above, and no other formats.</li>
  <li>Make error output specific to which problem occurs.</li>
</ul>
